            <h2 class="phone-headline-1">Samsung</h2>

            <p class="phone-paragraph-1">Samsung is quite a popular phone as well. Samsung Galaxy is a series of
                computing and mobile
                computing devices designed, manufactured and marketed by Samsung Electronics. The product line includes
                the Samsung Galaxy S series of high-end smartphones, the Samsung Galaxy Tab series of tablets, the
                Samsung Galaxy Note series of tablets and phablets with the added functionality of a stylus, and
                smartwatches including the first version of the Samsung Galaxy Gear, with later versions dropping the
                Galaxy branding, until the release of the Samsung Galaxy Watch in 2018.<br>

                Samsung Galaxy devices use the Android operating system produced by Google, usually with a custom user
                interface called One UI (with previous versions being known as Samsung Experience and TouchWiz).
                However, the Galaxy TabPro S is the first Galaxy-branded Windows 10 device that was announced in CES
                2016.

            <h2 class="phone-headline-2">iPhone</h2>

            <p class="phone-paragraph-2">The iPhone is definitely one of the most popular phones in circulation. The
                iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. All generations of the iPhone use
                Apple's iOS mobile operating system software. The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007,
                and multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.<br>

                The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The
                iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to cellular networks. An iPhone can take photos, play music, send and
                receive emails, browse the web, send and receive text messages, record notes, perform mathematical
                calculations, and receive visual voicemail. Shooting video also became a standard feature with the
                iPhone 3GS. Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be
                enabled by downloading mobile apps. As of January 2017, Apple's App Store contained more than 2.2
                million applications available for the iPhone.</p>

            <h2 class="phone-headline-3">Google pixel</h2>
            <p class="phone-paragraph-3">Google Pixel is a brand of consumer electronic devices developed by Google that
                run either Chrome OS or the Android operating system.<br>
                The Pixel is one of the more reasonably sized Android phones you can get. It measures 5.7 by 2.7 by 0.3
                inches (HWD) and weighs 5 ounces. The Galaxy S7 is nearly identical, at 5.6 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, but
                slightly heavier at 5.4 ounces. The 4.7-inch iPhone 7 is smaller and lighter than both at 5.4 by 2.6 by
                0.3 inches and 4.9 ounces.<br>

                Like the larger XL, the back of the Pixel has a pane of glass inlaid in the upper half, with a
                fingerprint sensor set in the middle. It's a unique design that prevents the Pixel from looking like
                every other phone out there. With Pixel Imprint you can register up to five fingerprints to unlock the
                phone, though it seems to take ever-so-slightly longer to wake and unlock compared with the Galaxy S7
                and iPhone 7. Motion gestures let you swipe down on the fingerprint scanner to access the notifications
                shade, which is convenient.</p>
