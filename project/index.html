            <h1>We run Rivers to relax</h1>

            <p>We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar
                philosophy of boating. <br> Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the
                beauty that surrounds the
                rivers we love.</p>

            <h2>We run Whitewater for the Rush</h2>
            <p>That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that
                tenseness that comes when you are <br> looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you
                appreciate the calm beautiful water
                that always follows even more.</p>
